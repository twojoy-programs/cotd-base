1) cotd-scripts.pl
- function name "crap" is hilarious!!! :-)

- for the #unportable dates, try using the following:
use Time::Piece;
# ...
# ...

my $date = localtime->strftime('%m/%d/%Y');


# print $date; # yields "06/15/16"


2) cotd-scripts.pl
- lines 34 and 36 need semicolons

- would a relative path solve the #unportable paths?
E.g...
replace:
$logfile     = `pwd` . "/cotd.log"; # Unportable
with:
$logfile     = "./cotd.log"; # relative

and replace:
$sounds      = `pwd` . "/sounds";   # ditto
with:
$sounds      = "./sounds";   # ditto



3) select.pl
- I see the meat of the work is here!

- I want to research a little more on how to perform lines 45-51 (and the other couple with system and unlink) in a more portable manner
- more comments on this to come.

Coupon of the Day Program
=========================
This is a program that will read out a coupon (or other piece of text) out to a
user who asks for it on a "walkie-talkie service". It's currently a
work-in-progress, and help would be appreciated. If you need docs, go to
`docs/README.md`. If you're a developer, and you're inetrested in helping, look
at `docs/dev/TODO.md`. One more thing: the name is sometimes abbreviated to
COTD.

Standard for parameter file
===========================
This is the standard for the parameter file of the main Coupon of The Day
program. The parameter file is generated by the adapter program, which
interfaces with the APIs of the various "walkie-talkie" clients. This file shall
consist of perl code that fills in all of the values listed below that it can. When the adapter program detects that a user has spoken, it calls the main COTD program, passing the file as an argument, and then creates the file within 5 seconds of calling the main program.

`$audiofile`: Location of the audio file (ogg format) with the user's speech.

`$pid`: Process ID of the COTD program.

`$uid`: Some sort of user ID.

`$service`: Full name of the service the user is speaking thru.

`$unique-uid`: User ID number prefixed with short name of service and dash.

`$service-short`: Short name of service

`$reply-audiofile`: Path to audio file which the COTD program should reply with.
